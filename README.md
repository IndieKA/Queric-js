# Queric-js

Queric-js is a simple JavaScript framework used to make Processing.Js development in Khanacademy *much* easier. Rather than manually implementing things like collisions, Queric-js will automatically handle things like these, without making the developer do as much work.

The first few commands in 0.1 of Queric! These console-commands 
were created by Seabass [@IndieKA](https://github.com/IndieKA) and
[kingcodefish](https://github.com/kingcodefish), as well as some other
developers off-site of GitHub. Currently the lanuguage is under heavy testing
and is not to be downloaded as it has many bugs.
