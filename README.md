# Queric-js
The first few commands in 0.1 of Queric! These console-commands 
were created by Seabass @IndieKA (https://github.com/IndieKA) and
KCF (kingcodefish) (https://github.com/kingcodefish), as well as some other
developers off-site of GitHub. Currently the lanuguage is under heavy testing
and is not to be downloaded as it has many bugs.
