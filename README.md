# Queric-js

Queric-js is a simple JavaScript framework used to make Processing.JS development in Khan Academy *much* easier. Rather than manually implementing things like collisions, Queric-js will automatically handle things like these, without making the developer do as much work.

# Attribution

The first few commands in 0.1 of Queric! These console-commands 
were created by Seabass [@IndieKA](https://github.com/IndieKA) and
[kingcodefish](https://github.com/kingcodefish), as well as some other
developers off-site of GitHub. The language is currently under development
and can't be downloaded at the moment. Feel free to contribute anything.
